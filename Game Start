STRANDED
=====================

You come to still in the plane buckled to your seat. 
You look around but no one else seems to be in the plane. Who knows how long youâ€™ve been out; 
It was night during the crash but now the sun rises on the horizon. You should get up and find out what happened. 

Type ls to look around your area. Type ./ before an object to interact with that object.
