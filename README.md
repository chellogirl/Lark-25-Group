Developed by: McKenzie Michael and Angelica Louis

Narrative: 
The pilot tells the passengers there is no fuel left in the plane, and he has to land in the Pacific Ocean. As the plane descends, the flight attendants tell everyone to get their life vests. Once everyone is off the plane, the pilot's job is to help everyone from the island. Since you are stranded on the island, your only choice is to live or die.

You come to still in the plane, buckled to your seat. You look around, but no one else is on the plane. Who knows how long you've been out. It was night during the crash, but now the sun rises on the horizon. You should get up and find out what happened. Type ls to look around your area. Type ./object to interact with an object.
